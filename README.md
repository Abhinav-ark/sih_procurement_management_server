# NEEPCO Procurement Management Portal Server

- Our Aim is to develop an online portal for NEEPCO (North Eastern Electric Power Corporaton) so that the process of procurement of goods can be streamlined.
- The online portal will maintain a detailed record of the procurement activities (including payments) and vendor details.
- Efficient data entry, storage, retrieval will be given prime importance. Securing sensitive data about the payment transactions and about the members involved will also be done.
- The portal will also have additional features such as progress tracking,data analysis, RBAC (Role Based Access Control) and discussion forums.
